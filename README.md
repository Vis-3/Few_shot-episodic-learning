This project explores the application of few-shot episodic learning for classifying knee MRI images. We leverage the ResNet pre-trained model and achieve an accuracy of 81% on the test set.

Project Aim:
Demonstrate the feasibility of using few-shot learning for knee MRI classification, a task with limited labeled data.
Utilize a pre-trained ResNet model to extract meaningful features from knee MRI images.
Achieve competitive accuracy on the test set.
Dataset:
Knee MRI dataset (specify details, source, classes)
Methodology:
Few-shot episodic learning: trains on few examples per class and leverages meta-learning for generalization.
ResNet pre-trained model: extracts image features learned from a large dataset.
Fine-tuning: adapts the pre-trained model to the specific classification task.
Results:
Achieved 81% accuracy on the test set.
Remaining Work:
Parameter optimization: further tune hyperparameters for potential accuracy improvement.
Explore different distributions: investigate alternative data augmentation techniques and few-shot learning algorithms.
Analyze model interpretability: understand what features the model uses for classification.
Expand class coverage: include additional types of knee conditions.
